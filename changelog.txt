#----------------------------------- 0.23 ------------------------------------
[changed] Added log_level command line parameter and changed "executed task"
logger to log level INFO
#----------------------------------- 0.22 ------------------------------------
[fixed] setup.py-based installations. Ran into the bug myself :/
#----------------------------------- 0.21 ------------------------------------
[changed] where available, rpqueue will now use Lua to move delayed tasks from
    the time-based priority queue to fifo queues. This should reduce overhead
    in all cases, and should drastically improve performance for those that
    use large numbers of delayed tasks.
[changed] the version number is now PEP 386/440 compliant.
[added] this changelog that will document updates/changes/improvements in an
    easily referenced location.
[fixed] thanks to https://github.com/dmaust , rpqueue added a missing 'redis'
    requirement.
